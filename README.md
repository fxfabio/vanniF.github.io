# [Road Orientations Map](https://mourner.github.io/road-orientation-map/)

A visualization of road orientations for the current map view.
Explore the map to see the chart for your city!

Divides 360&deg; into 64 bins and accumulates lengths of road segments with corresponding orientations,
then plots the distribution as a polar chart.
Two-way roads are counted for both directions.
